<h1>Careers in Web and Digital Design</h1>
	<h3>By. Geran Smith, January 14, 2020</h3>
	
<p>The growth of the web over the last couple of decades has brought with it some new job titles. For example, had anyone ever heard of a webmaster prior to the mid-1990s? It has also redefined some older titles like advertising sales rep. Advertising sales reps used to sell ad space or time only in magazines and newspapers and on radio and television. Over the last two decades, they've added Websites to their repertoire.</p>
<p>Can you think of any company that does not have a web presence? The Web and Digital Design Pathway here at Paulding County High School will equip students with the ability to plan, design, and create  websites. Students will not only learn how to  write code, they will also learn various forms of multimedia elements.  These elements include text, graphics, animation, sound, video and digital imaging, photography, in addition to computer programming, visual development, project development and web processes.  Skills learned will help students create and design websites that incorporate digital media elements used to enhance content of a website. Students in this pathway will learn to work individually and in teams to create web professional looking web sites.  Professional communication skills and practices, problem-solving, ethical and legal issues, and the impact of effective presentation skills will be enhanced in this pathway to prepare students to be college and career ready.</p>
<p>As you can see below, careers in this field are not just for techies. This growing industry welcomes those who are creative and business-minded as well.  If you are interested in working in the technology industry ,  here are some occupations to consider.</p>

	<p>Web developers need a combination of graphic design skills and technical computer skills that will allow them to create particular designs on web pages. In addition to looking nice, websites need to be functional and secure. It is the responsibility of web developers to create such sites that meet the requirements of employers or clients. Web developers often are implementing ideas that others may have even those others lack the technical know-how to turn those ideas into an actual, functional website. Web developers build and shape visitors’ experiences at websites. They do this through the creation of page layouts (headings and paragraphs), website styling (colors and fonts), and page features (animations and pictures). Interactive features, such as submitting online payments securely, are a necessary feature of e-commerce sites. In some settings, web developers can get started with no more than a high school diploma, but an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree typically is needed to advance in the field. This job generally requires the ability to do the following work:</p>
	<ul><li>Graphic Design</li>
		<li>Know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other relevant web design coding languages</li>
		<li>Collaberate</li>
		<li>Present design specs</li>
		<li>Troubleshoot website problems</li>
		<li>Maintain and update websites</li>
		<li>Stay up to date on technology</li></ul>
<p>While many employers prefer to hire job candidates with a bachelor's degree in a computer-related field, some will consider those with experience and certification only. Web developers earned a median annual salary of $77,010 in 2017 according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
